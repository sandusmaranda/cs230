## Exercise: Tree Terminology

This exercise tests your understanding of some definitions for trees. Consider the following tree:

![]([images]tree.png)

1. Produce a preorder traversal of this tree.
2. Produce an inorder traversal of this tree.
3. Produce a postorder traversal of this tree.
4. Produce a level-order traversal of this tree.
5. Draw an array to represent this tree using the computed links implementation strategy.
6. Draw an array to represent this tree using the stored links implementation strategy. For this question, place the nodes in the array in alphabetical order.
Use -1 to denote the location of a child that does not exist.
7. What is the big-O time complexity of the find operation in the LinkedBinaryTree class?
8. What is the time complexity of the inorder operation in the LinkedBinaryTree class?




**Good luck!**
