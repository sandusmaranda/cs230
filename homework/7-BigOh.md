## Learning Goals

* Understanding the Big-O complexity at the level of individual statements and methods


##Exercise: Find the running time of statements in a method

Before starting this task make sure you review the handout on Efficiency of Algorithms and read Chapter 12 of the textbook.

Consider the following method that removes a CD from a linear collection (e.g. array).

Assume that the collection has `n` CDs to start with. Answer each of the questions below. Provide your answer by writing a sentence for each Question, and then explaining the Big-O notation associated with the relevant statement. **Note:** If you find any of the Questions ambiguous (that is, it may mean two different things and you are not sure which one is the correct interpretation), explain why and give your answer **for each alternative**.

Write your answer on a text .txt file (not a Word .doc or other special format, just plain text) and submit it in the proper assignment folder.
