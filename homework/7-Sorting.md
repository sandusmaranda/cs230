# Trace Sorting by hand


##Learning Goals
* Gain a detailed understanding on how sorting algorithms work
* Working with best-known sorting algorithms

## Exercise: Trace Sorting Algorithms

Complete the following questions on paper by hand, scan them as a PDF, and submit as the file `SortingTrace.pdf` to Gradescope.

Given the following array of numbers:

`255 31 15 127 511 1023 63 7 2047`

Show a trace of execution for each of the sorting methods as shown in the book:

1. selection sort (listing 13.5, page 492)
2. insertion sort (listing 13.5, page 493)
3. merge sort (listing 13.5, page 495)
4. radix sort (code on lecture slide)

The meaning of **"trace"** depends on each sorting method.

* For selection sort, it means to display the contents of the array at every selection.
* For insertion sort, it means to display the contents of the array after each insertion.
* For mergesort, it means to draw the two trees that are created by splitting and merging.
* For radix sort it means to display the contents of the array at the end of each phase. Not necessary to display the queues. Pad the input numbers with zeros as needed.

## What to submit
* Make sure you title your paper and you write your name(s) on the document you are submitting.
*   Create a PDF file named `SortingTrace.pdf` by scanning the completed worksheet and submit to Gradescope.
