## Learning Goals

* Gaining experience of multiple implementations of the same interface
* Debugging programs that require understanding of pointers
* Work with the javafoundations package

# Two Implementations of the Queue Interface 

* Before starting this task make sure you review the handout on Queues and read section 15.1-15.5  of the textbook.

* In class we discussed one full implementation of the `Queue` interface (`ArrayQueue`) and two partial implementations: (<code>LinkedQueue, CircularArrayQueue</code>). 

* Download the starter code [QueueImplementation.zip](assign601/QueueImplementation.zip) to work on.

* For this task, you are asked to complete and test the partial implementations: `LinkedQueue` and `CircularArrayQueue`.

* **Design your solutions on paper before you start programming on a computer**. Trying to code on the computer without knowing exactly what to code is a waste of time and results in a sense of frustration and despair. Do not do this to yourselves! Keep a PDF or PNG of your design and submit it with your code.

* The starter code includes also the *beginning of a driver* `Qtest` aimed to show that your implementation works correctly. 

* You need to complete the two Queue implementations, test them thoroughly, and  provide javadoc documentation for the classes you will edit.


## How to submit your Work
When done, submit the `LinkedQueue.java`, `CircularArrayQueue.java` and `Qtest.java` files along with the `QtestTesting.txt` transcript of your solutions. Include the PDF or PNG of your design.

* And remember to edit the @author and @version fields of your javadoc!



**Good luck!**
