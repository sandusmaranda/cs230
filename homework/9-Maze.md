## Learning Goals

* To understand the correspondence between Graphs and Mazes
* To understand how a graph algorithm can solve a maze problem


## Exercise: Solving a maze

### This exercise involves NO programming.

Consider the following maze:

![]([images]maze.png)

Think about how you would model this maze as a graph so that you can employ graph traversal algorithms in order to solve it. By solving a maze we mean to have an algorithm that, entering from the top opening of the maze will exit at the bottom opening.

Some questions to consider:
1. How do you decide what is a vertex?
2. How do you decide what is an edge or an arc?
3. Show the data structure that represents the graph defined by the vertices and edges/arcs you chose.
4. Show the DFS and BFS traversals of the graph defined by your data structure
5. Which traversal is better? How did you decide?

Write up your answer on paper and take a photo of it. Submit one PDF file, named `MazeOnPaper.pdf` that contains your answers to all questions, clearly marked: "Task 1 Answer" to "Task 2 Answer", etc.

Make sure the document you submit contains your name.


**Good luck!**
