# Homework 10, Part A: Hash Tables


## Goals
* Better understanding of using a Hash Table
* Designing a program on your own



## Exercise: Use Hashtables to analyze word frequencies

In this exercise, you will use a hash table to count frequencies of words in some files.


### Task 0 

Download the [DataFiles](static_files/DataFiles.zip) for testing your work.

### Task 1
Look at `WordTable_Hash.java` below. In the code, a hash table was used to count word frequencies in a single file. Go over the code, and make sure you understand it well before moving on. You should use parts of that code in the program you will write in the next step.

`WordTable_Hash.java`:
```java
import java.util.Hashtable;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Enumeration;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

/* Read in a text file and store the number of occurrences of distinct word in the file.
 * You should use the file name and relative path as a command-line argument
 * E.g., "DataFiles/GreenEggs.txt"
 */
public class WordTable_Hash  {

    // Instance variables
    private int totalWords;
    private Hashtable<String, Integer> table;

    // Constructor
    public WordTable_Hash() {
        totalWords = 0;
        table = new Hashtable<String, Integer>();
    }

    // Instance methods
    public void readInFile(String filename) {
        try {
            Scanner reader = new Scanner(new File(filename));
            while (reader.hasNext()) {
                String word = reader.next();
                if (table.containsKey(word)) {
                    int previousCount = table.get(word);
                    table.put(word, previousCount+1);
                }
                else table.put(word, 1);
                totalWords++;
            }
            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            System.out.println(ex);
        }
    }

    public int getTotalWords() {
        return totalWords;
    }

    public int getNumDistinctWords() {
        return table.size();
    }

    public String toString() {
        return table.toString();
    }

    public void printKeysAndValues(){
        Enumeration contents = table.keys();
        String key;
        System.out.println("Key: \t Value: \n");
        while(contents.hasMoreElements()) {
            key = (String) contents.nextElement();
            System.out.println(key+ "\t" + table.get(key));
        }
    }

    public static void main (String[] args) throws IOException {
        if (args.length == 0)
            System.out.println("When executing this application, please enter the name of a file as a command line arguemnt.");
        else {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
            WordTable_Hash wt = new WordTable_Hash();
            wt.readInFile(args[0]);
            long stop = System.currentTimeMillis();

            // Output results
            //System.out.println("The contents of the word frequency table are: ");
            //System.out.println(wt);
            System.out.println("Using WordTable_Hash");
            wt.printKeysAndValues(); // to enumerate them
            System.out.println("The file has " + wt.getTotalWords() + " words");
            System.out.println("of which " + wt.getNumDistinctWords() + " are different");
            System.out.println("Reading in file took " + (stop-start) + " milliseconds.");
        }
    } 
}
```


### Task 2
In this part, we will count word frequencies among multiple files, in particular all the files contained in a given directory (folder). The input of the program should be the name of a directory to be processed.
The output of the program should include:
* the total number of words read from **all files** in the given directory
* the number of distinct words in there, and
* the most frequent word among all files, together with its frequency.

You can iterate over the files in a directory like this:

```java
import java.io.File;

// args[0] is the name of a directory
dir= new File(args[0] + "/");

// dir points to the directoryâ€™s contents
File[]files= dir.listFiles();
System.out.println(files.length + "files");

for (File f : files) 
  if (!f.isHidden()) 
    process(f);
```    

The design of this program, i.e, what methods to have, what inputs they may take etc, is left up to you. As you design your application, remember some of the basic principals for writing code:
 * break your code into methods so that each method definition is not too long
 * code repetition (writing the some piece of code more than once) should be avoided
 * the `main()` method should be short, high-level and basically only call other methods
 * use descriptive names for methods, variables etc to improve the readability and the overall quality of your code



**Specifications:**
Please adhere to the following specifications:

* Name your program `WordFrequenciesDirectory_Hash.java`
* Your program should take the name of the folder to be processed as a **command line argument**. If no command line argument is provided by the user, the downloaded folder `DataFiles` should be used as input.
* Structure your output to look similar to this:

<pre>
Folder processed: DataFiles
Total number of words read: 1501990  
Number of distinct words: 60660
Most frequent word: the (frequency: 55965)
</pre>


### Task 3
Once you are done with the previous task, try to add some more functionality to your program:

Given a specific word, present the number of times it has repeated among all files in the directory processed by your program. Notice that it is left up to you how to get the "specific word" into your program.  Some ideas include:

* Hardwire it into your program
* Get it as (one more) command line argument
* Ask the user to type the word in the keyboard and read it into your program
* Perhaps, get in a dialogue with the user and allow them to enter, through the keyboard, more than
one such words.



### What to submit

 Submit to Gradescope your `WordFrequenciesDirectory_Hash.java` and your **testing transcript**  (running your program on the DataFiles directory you downloaded).

# Homework 10, Part B: Trees

## Exercise: Tree Terminology

This exercise tests your understanding of some definitions for trees. Consider the following tree:

<img src="_images/figs/tree.png" />

1. Produce a preorder traversal of this tree.
2. Produce an inorder traversal of this tree.
3. Produce a postorder traversal of this tree.
4. Produce a level-order traversal of this tree.
5. Draw an array to represent this tree using the computed links implementation strategy.
6. Draw an array to represent this tree using the stored links implementation strategy. For this question, place the nodes in the array in alphabetical order.
Use -1 to denote the location of a child that does not exist.
7. What is the big-O time complexity of the find operation in the LinkedBinaryTree class?
8. What is the time complexity of the inorder operation in the LinkedBinaryTree class?



### What do submit

Submit to gradescope a single file, `TreeTerminology.pdf`, containing your answers.
