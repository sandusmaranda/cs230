# The Big Ideas in CS230

**Data Abstraction:** Separate a program's behavior from its implementation.

**Modularity:** Reusable components with standard interfaces.

**Performance Analysis:** How efficient is your code with respect to space and time?

**Standard Abstract Data Types:** We'll cover the classical data structures including lists, stacks, queues, trees, tables and graphs.


# Learning Goals

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

* Identify abstract data types and fundamental algorithms and summarize their typical uses, strengths, and weaknesses.
* Use, implement, and modify various data structures including lists, stacks, queues, trees, tables and graphs.
* Understand tradeoffs between different implementations of an abstract data type.
* Analyze runtime efficiency of searching and sorting algorithms and abstract data type operations.
* Solve substantial computational problems by using the Java programming language, object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms.  
* Work with a team to design, implement and test computer programs.
