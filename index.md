# Overview

**Description:** An introduction to techniques and building blocks for organizing large programs. Topics include: modules, abstract data types, recursion, algorithmic efficiency, and the use and implementation of standard data structures and algorithms, such as lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, priority queues, tables, sorting, and searching. Students become familiar with these concepts through weekly programming assignments using the Java programming language. 

**Lab:** This course has a required co-requisite lab - CS 230L.

**Prerequisites:** A student is required to have confirmation of authorization from the CS 111 faculty that is based on the mastery of the CS 111 concepts in order to enroll in CS 230. Students who did not take CS 111 at Wellesley and who wish to enroll in CS 230 should contact the CS department to take a placement questionnaire.
